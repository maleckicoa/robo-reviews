Name: AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count) Title: A++ Review: Greaatttt deal. This probably the only way I'll be buying batteries at a good price too. Name: AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count) Title: Five Stars Review: Good procuct!! Name: AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count) Title: Great battery for most applications Review: Just as good as Duracell as far as I am concerned. Name: AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count) Title: You should buy!!! Review: I am just speechless with these batteries. They are probably the best deal for good quality batteries you will ever find. I feel like they should cost more because they are really good and last a long time. In a way, I feel like they can compete with Duracell batteries. Name: AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count) Title: No complaints for the price!! Review: I have tried numerous brands of disposable batteries: big (costly) name brands, cheaper name brands,brands made companies that make electronics,ect.I would say these are better than the cheaper name brands ... But, not as good as the high dollar name brands. They fall in the middle, and for the price you really can't complain!!They are individually wrapped in packs of 4 , which is nice. We have used in Xbox remotes (last about 4\/5 weeks with moderate use) Children's toys (seem to drain quicker in the toys) And portable CD players (average drain)Overall, I am happy with them and would definitely buy again! Name: AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count) Title: Awesome batteries! Review: This is actually the second or third time I have ordered these and by that evidence it should be obvious that I really love the quality and value of these batteries. I have bought the crappy ones from the dollar store but they seriously don't last. Not worries with these bad boys! I don't need to replace them anymore often than the name brand . If this review helped you, click YES below. Thank you! Name: AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count) Title: Great Deal Review: Great deal on batteries. Name: AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count) Title: Batteries that work Review: Difficult to be excited about AA batteries but everything about the purchase was as advertised. They were well packaged and even arrived several days early. They are working well. My regret is that I did not order AAA batteries at the same time.

Name: AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count) Title: WORST PURCHASE OF BATTERIES IN HISTORY, BUYER BEWARE! Review: I will never purchase batteries online ever again! I should have never believed that this is Unique Japanese technology that enables better performance after storage, over-discharge, and high temperatures, because frankly IT DID NOT EVEN LAST FOR TWO DAYS FOR MY DIGITAL CLOCK THAT HAS FOUR PLACEMENTS OF AAA BATTERIES. At first I believed it was a bad batch of a four pack batteries, no problem, THEN, a week and a half has passed and I had to change the batteries for my clock FIVE TIMES! I hope this review will convince you (the reader) to never purchase these batteries, I know they are not that expensive and I shouldn't make a big deal out of it, but it is frustrating to see the seller LIE MORE THAN ONCE, took their sweet a** time to deliver it to the buyer (about a month in waiting), and never sent any form of confirmation in purchasing their product. Well that's that, have a good one!

As a college student who spends a ton of time playing Xbox, my roomates and I went through batteries by the dozen and were always short. Instead of taking them out of any device we coud get our hands on (remotes, calculators, etc) we decided to just get these in bulk. They are much cheaper than getting anything in store and last long enough that we didnt notice a difference. A pair in an Xbox 360 controller lasted a good 4 months with almost daily use which is better than most batteries in my opinion.

    "summary_reviews_string":"Name: Amazon Kindle Paperwhite - eBook reader - 4 GB - 6 monochrome Paperwhite - touchscreen - Wi-Fi - black,,, Title: Great Reader Review: With my love of turning paper pages in a book and not being a techie, I held off rushing into buying one of the many tablet readers available. I spent quite a bit of time reading reviews and talking to others before making my decision, and I am so glad I did my research. What I like most about the Kindle Paperwhite: the adjustable screen lighting is spot on and easy on my eyes, whether I am reading in dim room light or bright sunshine outside; the ease of syncing it with my computer and wifi; the speed of downloading a book; the ability to adjust the font size; the ability to bookmark and pick up from where I stopped reading; and the size and weight which makes it very portable. I opted for an envelop-style sleeve for storage rather than a cover you might use for an iPad or similar tablet. It's easy to slip the reader out of the sleeve and begin reading. I am thrilled with this device and give it two thumbs up. For me, there is no substitution for the feel of real paper, but this reader comes close. Name: Amazon Kindle Paperwhite - eBook reader - 4 GB - 6 monochrome Paperwhite - touchscreen - Wi-Fi - black,,, Title: Good for aging eyes and arthritic fingers! Review: If, like I, you own an earlier generation Kindle that isn't a Paperwhite, this latest model is WELL WORTH THE UPGRADE.If you don't, it's like having a wider but really no thicker or heavier iPhone 6 Plus to read your Kindle app books (and to use Goodreads) on outdoors. (It even has Airplane Mode.)It had me at its crisp, crisp backlit display and quick response to touch. (I had to really press vs. tap on the older Kindle, and it was so slow to take\/load.) Name: Amazon Kindle Paperwhite - eBook reader - 4 GB - 6 monochrome Paperwhite - touchscreen - Wi-Fi - black,,, Title: Pleasantly Surprised Review: As an avid book reader, I have always loved having an actual book. I was very reluctant to get a Kindle at first. However, It has been such a surprise. It's very light weight and thus easier to hold then a traditional book. You can easily download new books at the click of a button. There are daily and monthly deals you can take advantage of for a fraction of the cost of a regular book. The viewing experience is superb because you can change fonts and size and increase or decrease background lighting, making it very easy to read in any light. If I don't know a word I can automatically look up the definition or add highlights or notes. Plus, I can carry an entire library with me where ever I go. I actually read way more now than I ever did before. I am extremely impressed with this device and it's more than exceeded my expectations. I highly recommend it to anyone. Name: Amazon Kindle Paperwhite - eBook reader - 4 GB - 6 monochrome Paperwhite - touchscreen - Wi-Fi - black,,, Title: Love it but for one thing Review: I read as many reviews as I could find before buying this newest Paperwhite and what struck me the most was the contrast of the bright screen versus the print. However, when I got mine, I had to put the brightness level to 19 (out of 25) to get it to a comfortable setting. Doing that makes my battery run down before I've even read two books, and that is with the airplane setting on, meaning the WIFI is off. Luckily, I bought a charger so I can charge my Paperwhite while on trips ( without my computer, in a regular outlet) or at night when I'm finished reading. Now for the positives. I love the light weight of this Kindle even with the preferred cover that shuts it into sleep mode when closed. I absolutely LOVE the dictionary feature, because it is so easy to use and it saves the words I don't know, for study. After I've learned a word's meaning, I can delete it from the list. I got the Paperwhite with the ads, because it is nice getting suggestions of books I might enjoy that I might not see otherwise. And books are easy to order from the Kindle Store and to download through this devise. I like the cover, because it protects the screen from scratches while stored in my purse and I also purchased a stylus to keep fingerprints off the screen and I like that. Generally, I am happy with this purchase. Name: Amazon Kindle Paperwhite - eBook reader - 4 GB - 6 monochrome Paperwhite - touchscreen - Wi-Fi - black,,, Title: I like my new Kindle Paperwhite Review: I have a 2nd generation Kindle and1st generation Kindle Fire. I hardly use those now. I also have an iPad mini, and an iPad Air. I like the Kindle Paperwhite because it's just for reading and so small, it hardly takes up any room in my purse. I enjoy reading novels on the Kindle PW especially with the backlight, more than I like reading on my iPad now. Name: Amazon Kindle Paperwhite - eBook reader - 4 GB - 6 monochrome Paperwhite - touchscreen - Wi-Fi - black,,, Title: Good with issues Review: Reading a book, it's great. Working with PDF files, not so great. Also please be aware that Amazon Customer Service will treat you like a pariah because you purchased this Kindle from Best Buy instead of directly through their store. Name: Amazon Kindle Paperwhite - eBook reader - 4 GB - 6 monochrome Paperwhite - touchscreen - Wi-Fi - black,,, Title: Great Product Review: The Paperwhite is an excellent product. It is very lightweight, easy to hold for long periods of time, and user-friendly (software wise). Be prepared to have a slower reaction time than a typical tablet (or Amazon Fire); this is because of the e-ink. However, I will take the trade off, as you are able to read e-ink in every environment (sunlight, dark rooms) without any eyestrain -- something that is not possible with a regular tablet. Screen response time is only slightly delayed because of this.If you have a Prime membership, you have access to all of Amazon's library, which has a large selection; however, most disappointingly, you can only rent one book per month unless you upgrade to Amazon's Kindle App, which is an additional $10\/month. I find this to be mildly frustrating. However, you are able to rent books from your local library whenever you would like.Overall, I think the Paperwhite is a fabulous product for reading, with only a few drawbacks. I enjoy reading on it very much. Name: Amazon Kindle Paperwhite - eBook reader - 4 GB - 6 monochrome Paperwhite - touchscreen - Wi-Fi - black,,, Title: I Love Reading Again! Review: Well, it happened. I became a huge fan of e-books, preferring them over an actual, physical book! This old fashioned woman with a preference for all that is vintage NEVER EVER thought that would happen; then came the Kindle Paperwhite. I think I have read close to 10 books this past month because of the Paperwhite! I can make the font larger (which is great for my old eyes), and it is lit from the side, so it does not make my eyes tired like typical LCD screens, where the light shoots up at your eyes. Because of this, you can read easily in bright sun or in total darkness. Also, the battery lasts a very long time; I usually have to charge it only after reading a full book. And an added bonus is that you can't get any apps on the Paperwhite, which sounds like a negative, but that means there is no distraction\/temptation to surf the web instead of read. When you open it up, you are committed to reading. It is sooooo much better than my Nook, which makes my eyes tired and is a distraction.It is among the best purchases I have ever made! Name: Amazon Kindle Paperwhite - eBook reader - 4 GB - 6 monochrome Paperwhite - touchscreen - Wi-Fi - black,,, Title: Great E-Reader Review: I upgraded from a Nook Glowlight which I had dropped and cracked (the shaft of light emanating through the tiny crack was beginning to burn into my retina, so I figured it was time to upgrade). I really like the ease of this device - purchases download to it directly, and if you have existing files, you can email them directly to the kindle and it will format them accordingly. The definition on the paperwhite is really nice, and the backlight is gentle on your eyes (crucial if you are a late night reader like me). I have the \"special offers\" version, and it is not intrusive at all, just appears on your lock screen. Battery has been great so far.If you are an Amazon Prime member, they even throw you a free ebook each month. And yes, I bought a protective cover for it this time! Name: Amazon Kindle Paperwhite - eBook reader - 4 GB - 6 monochrome Paperwhite - touchscreen - Wi-Fi - black,,, Title: Purchased as a gift Review: I purchased this as a gift for my daughter and she loves it. Easy to read and stores all of her books. My only complaint is that it feels slow and sluggish when transitioning from one screen tk the next. Even turning the page feels slow. Not sure if it has a setting to change this but its a noticeable difference between this device and the kindle fire both with out of the bix settings. My daughter doesn't mind it and prefers the screen on the paperwhite for reading. Battery life is fantastic, its so good you can go on a weekend trip and leave the charger at home. Name: Amazon Kindle Paperwhite - eBook reader - 4 GB - 6 monochrome Paperwhite - touchscreen - Wi-Fi - black,,, Title: Kindle paperwhite Review: I just love my new Kindle paperwhite. Name: Amazon Kindle Paperwhite - eBook reader - 4 GB - 6 monochrome Paperwhite - touchscreen - Wi-Fi - black,,, Title: Great for a newcomer to e-readers Review: I've been rockin' one iPad or another since Apple launched them in 2010, and never saw the need for a dedicated reading device like the Kindle. That said, I picked one up on a whim during Black Friday and I finally understand what the fuss is about. The text customization options make it easy to design\/find the perfect reading experience, and the fact that I can send Instapaper articles to my Kindle from all my other devices is awesome. The fact that the screen is lit from the edges (as opposed to a backlight) makes it noticeably less draining on the eyes.Only downside is the fact that Amazon makes you spend $20 to get rid of those pesky special offers (which force you to swipe the screen to dismiss them every time the device is turned on). Name: Amazon Kindle Paperwhite - eBook reader - 4 GB - 6 monochrome Paperwhite - touchscreen - Wi-Fi - black,,, Title: Makes reading so much easier!!!! Review: I love reading!!! I was first using my iPad mini as an ereader. Originally it was purchased to be used strictly as an ereader but I found over time it was causing eye strain. I couldn't read for more that 2 hours without my eyes starting to hurt. After a little research and watching tons of Youtube videos I purchased my Paperwhite. I absolutely enjoy my kindle. It's light weight (my iPad weighs a ton), it's easy to download and access books, you can read on tons of platforms. I have been using an app called \"Overdrive\" to check out ebooks from the library. Now I don't have to get in my card and drive to my local library. I can just browse from my home via my smart phone. If you enjoy reading and your thinking about getting a kindle please do! It's the best purchase I've made in a long time! I was limited when I was using my iPad mini. Now it's like a whole new world has open up since I've started using my kindle. I have read several books by Stephen King since owning my kindle. Normally it would take me months to finish a book. Now it takes me days! Name: Amazon Kindle Paperwhite - eBook reader - 4 GB - 6 monochrome Paperwhite - touchscreen - Wi-Fi - black,,, Title: Excellent reader Review: This is a great reader and has lots of new features. Go with Kindle Paperwhite. Name: Amazon Kindle Paperwhite - eBook reader - 4 GB - 6 monochrome Paperwhite - touchscreen - Wi-Fi - black,,, Title: Amazing device so far Review: I just purchased it yesterday, and am no expert by far, but setup was a breeze. I also took it to the beach today and found that it was like reading a piece of paper. Amazing. Name: Amazon Kindle Paperwhite - eBook reader - 4 GB - 6 monochrome Paperwhite - touchscreen - Wi-Fi - black,,, Title: Best kindle yet Review: Back lighting is great. Much better than the shining light you pull out. The light on our old kindle could not be dimmed at night. Lots of cool new features! Name: Amazon Kindle Paperwhite - eBook reader - 4 GB - 6 monochrome Paperwhite - touchscreen - Wi-Fi - black,,, Title: Very Happy with Purchase Review: I had an older Kindle and enjoyed it for many years. After I accidentally left it out in the rain, I was worried that I would not enjoy the newer versions as much as I had the old version. I was wrong. I absolutely love it! I enjoy reading outdoors and it's great to be able to read into the night - the fact that it is backlit is great! Name: Amazon Kindle Paperwhite - eBook reader - 4 GB - 6 monochrome Paperwhite - touchscreen - Wi-Fi - black,,, Title: My first Kindle - Really enjoying it. Review: I especially like the variable lighting which allows me to read at night without any external light or in the brightest outdoor light. Name: Amazon Kindle Paperwhite - eBook reader - 4 GB - 6 monochrome Paperwhite - touchscreen - Wi-Fi - black,,, Title: Great Product Review: I have nothing but good things to say about the kindle! The Backlit screen makes reading at night very easy. I am a heavy reader and the battery still lasts for weeks!",

I prefer the e-ink screens over tablet screen when reading books. I decided to pick up the new Kindle Voyage. Here are my thoughts.First, the Kindle is much sleeker and lighter than the Paperwhite model. It's very easy to hold for a long length of time without getting tired.Secondly, the addition of the page turn buttons is a welcomed addition. The buttons make it so easy to hold the Kindle with one hand and turn pages.Lastly the screen. I marked off a star because I had to return my first Voyage directly to Amazon because the top half of the screen had a yellow tint to it that was very distracting while reading. The replacement Kindle Voyage that I received had a perfect screen and the 300 ppi looks amazing. That being said, Amazon needs to really focus on quality control because I've read that the yellow tint on the screen is a common issue. If you're spending $200 for an e-reader, then the screen should be perfect. Especially since this is the 3rd generation of the lighted screens for the e-readers.If you're an avid reader, then the Kindle Voyage would be a worthy upgrade to make.

It has several new hardware & coming software enhancements over the current model. However, unless you do an extreme amount of reading, I would not recommend upgrading if you owned the current PaperWhite generation. The high price does not justify it. Name: Kindle Voyage E-reader, 6 High-Resolution Display (300 ppi) with Adaptive Built-in Light, PagePress Sensors, Wi-Fi - Includes Special Offers Title: Awesome E-Reader Review: The Voyage is a great reader for those like myself who love to read books. The lines and images are crisp and clean. Its light weight even with the cover. The only thing is the origami cover was something that i would have thought of designing differently. It feels uncomfortable to hold... The device though is awesome and the page turn features are great you can use either side to turn pages. Would suggest to anyone who loves to read!!

It has several new hardware & coming software enhancements over the current model. However, unless you do an extreme amount of reading, I would not recommend upgrading if you owned the current PaperWhite generation. The high price does not justify it.

But if you are in the market this has an excellent display and quick page turns. The reason to buy a dedicated e-reader is the 3 week long battery life.

Review: Great looking display. Text is sharp and easy to read. The lighting of screen is wonderful for reading in lower light environments. This is a little more compact than the paper white model. I really love the page press button areas. Makes it so you can turn pages without adjusting your hand (as long as you are holding the voyage with your thumb resting in the button area).

Text is super-sharp, it's comfortable to hold, the built-in self-adjusting light is awesome, and you change the page by either swiping with your finger or pushing down on the bezel. Unfortunately, all those great features come at a $199 price that is $80 more than Amazon's Kindle Paperwhite and more than double the cost of the company's entry level reader, both of which are excellent in their own right. So five stars for the device itself and minus one star for the high price.

The auto-brightness works fine and is unnoticeable and it feels good in the hands. The new page squeeze feature is nice as is the haptic feedback when you squeeze the bezel.The power button is also much better placed now and the glass screen makes swiping and tapping the bookmark and location corner areas much easier. The backlight is now much more uniform than my 1st gen Paperwhite.The only issue I have is when displaying black blocks like the tree silhouette, I have what looks like a tiny bad pixel that kind of twinkles. And of course, this thing is expensive when compared to the Paperwhite.

I don't even use the touch screen page advance any more, with the haptic advance this can be done from the right or left side of the reader, an advantagefor us lefties. This is my fourth kindle, I keep upgrading due to all the changes and advances, I use my kindle every night and enjoy it very much and would highly recommend if you want to upgrade to the voyage, visit your local best buy and hold it in your hands and feel and see the difference.

For serious readers and users of library e-books, completly worth it. While nothing beats a real book experience, traveling 4 days plus per week nothing beats the portability and ability to add from the library or Amazon on the fly... Never have to seek out light to read by (a noticeable improvement in the backlight), exceptional direct sun readability, not affected by polarized sunglasses... Great battery life... Great build quality... I expect it to last a long time... Only upgraded as I lost my last kindle on the train.

I like the WiFi and the 3G because I like the freedom of downloading books and newspapers while in the car, at the beach, by the pool when another guest recommends a new book. I still haven,t figured out some of the buttons, and because it is smaller I am always turning the page. I have adjusted the font and how far apart the lines are, but it still seems like I'm doing more page turning.

You CANNOT get YouTube kids at all! No google apps. You can get some YouTube kids clones on the adult profile and add them to the kid's profile but they stink.

Keep in mind isn't intend for kids her age but make sure there is adult supervision. Pluses: the tablet can take a good beating. Tons of hard tapping and even with the tough case can even take biting as well without causing any damage to the pink case. ( daughter is teething lol) . I'm a Amazon prime member,which gives access to tons of shows and free apps. So if you have Prime you can totally take advantage of a full library of entertainment. Some of the apps are great even for my 9 month old daughter works great to keep her entertained. Also when she is older I have tons of options to change and control. Also I get my own side she can't do anything unless I give her action.Cons: Average battery life 5-6hours tops of nonstop use and also wish that there was a way to lock the screen while watching Amazon, Netflix or any other video app so when my daughter taps in any direction or anywhere that the videos wouldn't stop playing.

And it does do everything I wanted it to do for her. The free year of Amazon Freetime is an awesome bonus!! The only problem I have with it is that whenever your wifi gets turned off and then back on, your apps on the kids profile have to load again almost as if they haven't been downloaded yet. This happens if the wifi strength gets weak also and it really frustrates my daughter who is 4 years old. I wish that could be fixed because other than that, the tablet is GREAT for my daughter and she has so much fun with it!! I'm sure other kids will love it also!!

The screen cracked a month ago and Amazon promptly replaced the device without incident. Great 2 yr replacement plan! Shortly after that, my older son who previously used a Nook finally broke. I decided since younger brother had a Kids Kindle, that we would purchase a second one to replace the Barnes and Nobles Nook. I love the fact that I can control what is on his profile. I love that it uses a micro usb charger and the warranty was the biggest selling feature. My boys are 5 and 7 and they are not very careful sometimes. My son did however get a kindle with a Pink case because it was all that Best Buy had in stock. I wish that cases were cheaper and I would gladly replace it. Best tablet for this age and in this price range.Cons: No google play store, slow sometimes, have to re-download apps frequently when running out of space, lack of popular apps.

It does have some flaws though. When he closes an app and then tries to open it again sometimes it has to download all over again. Also, even though apps are supposed to work without wifi, apps will load up fine and then we receive an error message saying we have to download the app again although the app is running perfectly in the background without wifi. Eventually all apps will disappear from the screen until we get back to wifi and restart the tablet.",

However, many express frustration with inconsistent durability, limited child-friendly content, and poor integration with third-party services. Battery life is average, and some users experience connectivity issues. Overall, the device falls short of expectations due to several drawbacks."

I love that it uses a micro usb charger and the warranty was the biggest selling feature. My boys are 5 and 7 and they are not very careful sometimes. My son did however get a kindle with a Pink case because it was all that Best Buy had in stock. I wish that cases were cheaper and I would gladly replace it. Best tablet for this age and in this price range.Cons: No google play store, slow sometimes, have to re-download apps frequently when running out of space, lack of popular apps.

Review: I purchased the Amazon - Fire Kids Edition - 7 Tablet - 16gb for my 75 year old mother after she broke her old tablet by dropping it. It took her a few hours to get used to it. Now, I cannot separate her away from it because it entertains her in so many ways and best of all she can drop the tablet and it will still work.

Name: Fire Kids Edition Tablet, 7 Display, Wi-Fi, 16 GB, Blue Kid-Proof Case Title: Great but aggravating at times Review: My son loves it. It does have some flaws though. When he closes an app and then tries to open it again sometimes it has to download all over again. Also, even though apps are supposed to work without wifi, apps will load up fine and then we receive an error message saying we have to download the app again although the app is running perfectly in the background without wifi. Eventually all apps will disappear from the screen until we get back to wifi and restart the tablet.",

However, some noted issues with durability, consistency, and limited parental controls. Overall, the product performed well, especially considering its affordable price."

    "summary_reviews_string":"Name: Amazon Fire Tv,,,\r\nAmazon Fire Tv,,, Title: I love my Alexa!! Review: Best Birthday present I ever got... I have my lights set up using Alexa and thermostat.. Also use the shopping list everyday helps to remember when I am at the store shopping.. love playing millions of trivia games and all the information she gives all day.. also love the many new apps added almost ever day... I Love my Alexa I highly recommend it!! Name: Kindle Dx Leather Cover, Black (fits 9.7 Display, Latest and 2nd Generation Kindle Dxs),, Title: Fun and useful assistant Review: I had been looking at the echo for awhile but wasn't an early adopter. As much as I geek out over products like this I wanted to wait till the skills library was a bit more tested and expanded. Well imagine my surprise when I got this as a gift! Absolutely love using my Echo\/Alexa. Weather, music, shopping lists, and the constant things they are adding. Yes it has its moments when it can't understand something but I do tend to mumble at times. Don't expect it to be a search engine giving multile results to an inquiry but it's a great speaker, home assistant, kitchen helper with measurements, and it even controls my home temperature on my Honeywell thermostat. Next purchase...smart plugs so I can turn some items off and on with my voice. Love the interactivity and I haven't even scratched the surface yet on all Alexa has to offer. I have found the Love my Echo website to discover new things I haven't tried yet. Name: Amazon Fire Tv,,,\r\nAmazon Fire Tv,,, Title: Outstanding for all ages Review: Echo or Alexa from Amazon is smart and learns along with you. She is a nice gift for teens as well as seniors. It's the kind of thing you might think you didn't want or need until you get it and begin to use it. We like the sound quality of the speaker. Name: Echo (White),,,\r\nEcho (White),,, Title: Very Easy Setup and Worth Every Penny Review: Setup was self explanatory. It doesn't take a genius. I have had the Echo Alexa for nearly a month and love everything about it. I have a rather large log home and decided to add the inexpensive smaller version called Echo Dot to the kitchen to be sure I could turn the smart lights on\/off\/dim without having to yell through the walls into the room where the Echo Alexa is located. Alexa did work the distance, but I had to yell to penetrate through the walls for the lights on the other side of the house. As a team, they both work like a charm. There is so much still to discover about Echo Alexa\/Echo Dot and there have been more and more apps and accessories added to the list just in the short time I have had it. Love it and discover more and more things about it as people are experimenting and posting things about it online. Worth every penny. Name: New Amazon Kindle Fire Hd 9w Powerfast Adapter Charger + Micro Usb Angle Cable,,,\r\nNew Amazon Kindle Fire Hd 9w Powerfast Adapter Charger + Micro Usb Angle Cable,,, Title: Good First Generation Product Review: Good product that does the basics. Too bad you have to buy a specific light control or security system to make this useful. My Smart TV's are connected to the internet, so why not control them too? But I was impressed when I asked \"Alexa, whats on TV for the Olympics tonight?\" and the response was Swimming at xx time, Gymnastics at yy time. Far more info than the TV guide on screen showing only a 4 hour block on NBC. It is the beginning of things to come. Name: Echo (White),,,\r\nEcho (White),,, Title: Awesome sound ! Review: Love the Echo ! Awesome tone to the sound ! Very easy to use I can use this paired thru Bluetooth with my iPhone or I can simply ask Alexa questions. I can access my music from my Spotify or Spotify in general and various other sources. my only recommendation for new products would be to have this be able to be on the charger and then portable not connected to a Wall outlet like the smaller version can be on the charger. However I had the smaller version first and the tone quality and volume were not that great plus i had to get up go across the room to tap it to change anything or ask it anything. the echo you can just talk to it across the room which makes it really easy for you to be lazy ha ha:) I received this as a birthday gift and I really am enjoying it ...highly recommend it! Name: Amazon Fire Tv,,,\r\nAmazon Fire Tv,,, Title: Fantastic new toy Review: I'm in love with my new echo. I own a multitude of wireless Bluetooth speakers that I have used in my garage while working for years. Simply comparing audio quality, I prefer the echo over my UE boom, which was my absolute favorite until this point. It doesn't have quite the bass the boom does, but it makes up for it in clarity, volume and bass responsiveness. Other than being a great speaker on its own, it's a fantastic task companion. The echo is set with every normal task you would ever need, and then some. I would happily buy another if anything were to ever happen to this one. Name: Amazon Fire Tv,,,\r\nAmazon Fire Tv,,, Title: Great for on-demand music and smart light control Review: Echo seems well engineered. The voice response is very natural and usually understands what I'm saying. Echo wouldn't connect to my home WiFi because I had two networks with the same SSIDs (one 2.4ghz and one 5ghz). Once I changed the name (SSID) of one of the networks, Echo connected right up and hasn't had any trouble since. Because of the WiFi issue, I took 1 star away. Name: Amazon Fire Tv,,,\r\nAmazon Fire Tv,,, Title: Complete connection Review: This thing is great! It connects to everything! Thank you Best Buy! Name: Amazon Fire Tv,,,\r\nAmazon Fire Tv,,, Title: Great and entertaining product! Review: I purchased this for my wife after she had seen one at a friends house. She loves it! It stays in the kitchen and she listens to music, sets cooking timers, gets weather reports and overall just enjoys it. It works flawlessly and is great entertainment for our grandson too! I would recommend this to anyone! Name: Amazon Fire Tv,,,\r\nAmazon Fire Tv,,, Title: Great source of information Review: Purchased this after extensive research between the Echo and the Google home. I must say that this is surprisingly handy. Weather updates in the morning and news headlines read back to me is pretty cool. The echo is very expandable with all the skills you can download to it to make it even better with its knowledge. There are some things that the Google Home does better as far as its answering (Google's search vs Bing) some questions and it's better at interacting with the person speaking, but I feel that Amazon will be learning to do the same thing with their future updates. Name: Echo (White),,,\r\nEcho (White),,, Title: Search engine could be better... Review: Search engine could be better ,but fine for simple questions. Great for playing music. Name: Amazon Fire Tv,,,\r\nAmazon Fire Tv,,, Title: Love The News Flash And Music Channels Review: Really like it but Alexa Search uses Bing which is very limited compared to Bing on line. Wish you could choose different search engine - I like Google over Bing. Thinking of getting Tap as well. Name: Kindle Dx Leather Cover, Black (fits 9.7 Display, Latest and 2nd Generation Kindle Dxs),, Title: Love our Echo Review: We love Alexa and our Echo. If we need an answer, all we have to do is ask Alexa. Name: Echo (White),,,\r\nEcho (White),,, Title: Great. Could be excellent. Review: Echo is an excellent gizmo for people on the Amazon eco system. It does\/has many things - music, weather, news, jokes, trivia, Bluetooth, speaker, good mics, home automation integration, calendar etc. It lacks an advanced capacity for web search which I suspect it's competition from Google may have. It also lacks in smart TV integration. Some other nice to have would have been a battery in it making it a little bit mobile and integration with other intranet speakers. Overall a good idea and one that will get better over time. Name: Echo (White),,,\r\nEcho (White),,, Title: Great for Home Automation Review: I'm not sure this device would have gotten much use if I didn't have any home automation devices. It is very continent to ask Alexa to turn off certain lights, set my thermostat to a certain temp and trigger events through IFTTT. I really don't use any of the other features like creating lists or scheduling events, but I do use the timer function while I am in the kitchen.The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 -Other devices cannot utilize my Echo's speaker, I would like for SmartThings to be able to integrate with my echo to announce when someone walks through a main entry door, or if my garage door opens, which I know other Wi-Fi connected speakers are capable of doing.Echo to Echo connectivity would also be a nice feature, being able to say \"Play music in all rooms\" or while standing in the kitchen \"Play music in the living room\" Name: Amazon Fire Tv,,,\r\nAmazon Fire Tv,,, Title: Great device that everyone in the family enjoys. Review: Have enjoyed it since we set it up the first night. Kids love to ask random questions every morning and the jokes are actually funny. Name: Amazon Fire Tv,,,\r\nAmazon Fire Tv,,, Title: Great assistant for simple things Review: I am very pleased with the purchase. I use Alexa to listen to my favorite TuneIn radio station in a foreign country, set timers when I'm cooking, ask the time in different cities in the world or basic culture questions. She responds to everything. If I want to play music, she will default to Amazon Prime. If you have the membership, it is very convenient to have Alexa. I have even placed orders on Amazon with my voice. I also have Hue lights so Alexa is the one turning off my house lights at the end of the day...ah, and I can ask her to do so from the upstairs level. I think this purchase is one of the best I've made this year. I am sure there is much more to tap on (no pun intended), and I'll find out as I use Echo more. For now, I totally recommend. Name: Echo (White),,,\r\nEcho (White),,, Title: It is a great speaker. Review: I love the voice controled volume. Having it synced up with my apps and the internet makes for great hsnds free information getting.",

    "summary_reviews_string":"Name: Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7\" Screen Title: ECHO SHOW is a MUST HAVE for Amazon Echo Fans! Review: When I first read about Amazon Echo Show, I thought the sound quality would be inferior to Echo because of the small size, which to me would be a deal breaker. I read that the sound is actually superior to Echo & it is compatible with most existing security cameras, so I decided to buy one. Then Best Buy ran a strong promotion if you buy 2, so I caved and bought 2. (I have a number of Echo's and 2) Echo Dots in the house). I am completely BLOWN AWAY by Echo Show!! Here is a brief summary of thoughts: LIKES: 1- Substantially the Best Sound Quality of any Echo to date, with stronger bass, directional stereo, Dolby Audio & focused sound field to the front. You can rock out louder, with less sound to the sides & back, so you do not share your music to all, as does the Echo.2- The 8) Far Field microphones are more effective than Echo. 3- High resolution 7\" screen is perfect for a desk or kitchen. 4- Song lyrics are great! (Free optional setting to turn on lyrics). 5- Photos of the album cover & the band on all music are awesome! 6- 3) buttons on top: Mute \/ Camera Defeat with red on screen indicator; Volume UP & Volume Down. 7- Excellent resolution with built-in camera. 8- Auto presence detector turns Show screen on when you are detected. 9- Speak to Alexa, just as with Echo or Dot, & Show mutes the volume & shows what you asked on the screen, with the music volume lowered in the background. 10- Ask the forecast & you get written & verbal forecast. You also get a second screen showing the next 4 days, including real feel, a picture of the anticipated weather, chance of rain, etc. 11- Say: Alexa, show me the \"Front Porch\", or any of the numerous security cameras & within 2 seconds, there is a highly detailed live video with sound! 12- Video conference - I do not know anyone else with Show yet, so I cannot try this but call yourself & you can see the picture they will see to adjust your surroundings. 13- Uses the same power supply as Amazon Echo. 14- Sleek shape fits right in with contemporary surroundings (see photo of Show in the center of the desk with 2) 4K monitors & iPad Pro). 15- The touch screen sensitivity is perfect. 16- Build quality is First Rate! 17- Rubber feet protect any surface & are anti - slip. 18- Addictive! More than any other device, this is one you will want in the center of your desk, as shown in my photo, because once you add the video component, you will wonder how you enjoyed music, sports, & just about everything, without it! 19- See your shopping list. 20- See visual confirmation that the lights you ask Alexa to turn on actually turned on. DISLIKES: NONE! I would only offer one design option. I would offer an optional Amazon Echo Show Wireless Subwoofer for this beast, that you could buy later. It would work like the many Soundbars that include a Wireless Sub. That would allow SHOW to not only ROCK OUT, but to shake the walls at the same time!I am seriously planning to sell some Echos & Dots to pick up a couple more Shows. They are GREAT!! Name: Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7\" Screen Title: Nice but some issues Review: I loved this thing until it was time to go to bed. Although it dims, the lowest setting is still very bright--like sleeping with a flashlight in your face. I hope they make fixes that will allow the screen to dim more. Also, not crazy about having a camera connected to the Internet on my nightstand. If you cover it up, the motion sensor then won't work. The sound is OK--not quite as good as the non-screen Echo--maybe because it's not omni-directional like the regular Echo. My enthusiasm for this device has subsided quite a bit because of these issues. Name: Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7\" Screen Title: Love it Review: Love that I can view my arlo cams on it , love it plays movie trailers on point , love the lyrics when playing music , love the video calls, love the drop in to other Alexa devices around the house (they now work as intercoms) so I can be in the 3rd floor of my house (3 story home in Las Vegas ) the doorbell rings I can say alexa show me front door (arlo cam) then I can say alexa open front door, drop in on the echo by front door and say come on up , Just having a blast with this stuff , yes I am in deep with the smart home thing.. alexa turn on the lights (hue color lights) , turn on the fan (wemo switches) Alexa set house to 77 degrees (nest ) so endless , yeah I would say the ECHO SHOW IS A GOOD START ... Name: Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7\" Screen Title: Returned a Nucleus for this gem and it is a beauty Review: I previously owned a Nucleus device which was similar to this device but was not a great device and had a lot of bugs and did not do much so I returned it. This device is a masterpiece! Not only is it tied into the Alexa Echo universe, it can be used as an intercom throughout your house with other Echos and also can be used to view things and even call people that have Echo directly. It is an amazing piece of hardware and Amazon should be proud of themselves for developing such a beautiful device! Name: Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7\" Screen Title: Must Have for the Home Review: This is an awesome product. This is the first Echo product I owned and I purchased 2 to get $100 off. I was going to split with a friend but like this so much that I decided to keep both. I've being singing along with the stream song with lyrics while doing work in the kitchen and house and watching youtube videos. The videos on Youtube takes a more effort to find the ones I want but I think this will improve over time. Name: Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7\" Screen Title: Pretty Cool Review: I got two of these, super easy to set up. Only used them one day so far.Can't fine one thing I don't like about them. Name: Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7\" Screen Title: AMAZING!! Review: I am starting my smart home and this was an addition to what we had already which was the dot and echo. This is simple to set up and the kids can even control it!! Name: Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7\" Screen Title: WORKS WELL -BUT Review: THE ECHO SHOW WORKS WELL, BUT AT THIS TIME IT CANNOT CONNECT TO YOUTUBE. MAYBE WHEN AMAZON WAKES UP THE CONNECTION WILL BE RETURNED. Name: Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7\" Screen Title: Good product Review: This product worked very well and very easy to use. Name: Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7\" Screen Title: Amazon show Review: Amazon show is pretty cool, It can help with things like cooking recipe, homework and other things. But it's restricted to only Amazon partner things. If Google comes out with something similar I would have definitely chosen that over the show. No YouTube. Name: Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7\" Screen Title: Awesome Review: We love Alexa! Love being able to watch news briefings, seeing the lyrics to songs, and so much more! It's in our kitchen and we use it everyday! Name: Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7\" Screen Title: ECHO Family Review: purchased the show after I picked up the ECHO PLUS, 2 DOT'S & a TAP! This smart home system is addictive and I will be adding more soon! Name: Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7\" Screen Title: I like it a lot. Review: I use it alot to play music instead of running the tv for my dog when we go somewhere. I use it for a lot of things. Name: Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7\" Screen Title: Very nice Review: I like how it has the screen but I do like the echo plus better. Both gets the job done Name: Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7\" Screen Title: Love the soundit Review: It is very enjoyable to be able to listen to the music at any time and great for parties and poolside. Name: Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7\" Screen Title: Excellent Review: Bought second one for my mom and she loves it so much Name: Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7\" Screen Title: Excellent Review: This is a must have is great for recepies, while you are cooking Alexa gives you the info. For the ines that are used to a tablet or iPod that you have to stop and read this is awesome plus. So much easier to follow things. Name: Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7\" Screen Title: Amazing!!!!! Review: not a real fan of AI, but Alexa has become quite handy, entertaining, and informative. The Show itself, allows us to contact family that is in Florida and teleconference with them, in 1 simple step.Shows family photos stored in Amazon account.One word, simply AMAZING!!!Bought 1 for my parents, and they USE it!!! Name: Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7\" Screen Title: The Echo Show is an excellent addition to our home Review: We really enjoy the Echo Show! I have the Echo in the living room & the Echo Show in the bedroom. It‚Äôs great to have the visual of all the requests for Alexa",

    "summary_reviews_string":"Name: AmazonBasics USB 3.0 Cable - A-Male to B-Male - 6 Feet (1.8 Meters) Title: Allows me to alternate printing from two printers near the computer Review: This is a good length cable for those that don't want tight connections because a cable is too short. I alternate back and forth between using two printers so having a longer cable allows me to keep two printers near the computer.Setup worked flawlessly, it hooked up easily and the computer recognized the usb connection. I was set to print and have been enjoying this cable ever since.Final thoughts, the best length of the cable really depends on your setup situation but a longer one like this gives you more flexibility of where you want your attached device. Name: AmazonBasics USB 3.0 Cable - A-Male to B-Male - 6 Feet (1.8 Meters) Title: Excellent, reliable cable with gold connectors. Review: The cable works without any issues. The connectors at both end are gold plated, and the cable is 9 feet long. The cable is shielded as in the picture, it's a plain cover. As in the picture, one side is the rectangle-shaped connector (which connects to your PC), and the other end is the new USB 3.0 stack connector (which connects to your device). Make sure your device has this connector. I have been using AmazonBasics cables for almost everything, HDMI, optical audio, USB, and they are all reliable. No issues with any of the twenty AmazonBasics cables I own. Name: AmazonBasics USB 3.0 Cable - A-Male to B-Male - 6 Feet (1.8 Meters) Title: Good value and good performance Review: I built my last home PC and used a motherboard with native USB 3.0 connectors. I've used this cable between a USB 3.0 hub and my computer's USB 3.0 ports. This cable features solid construction and good shielding. The connections work well, and the cable upholds USB 3.0 data throughput speeds to the flash drives and portable USB 3.0 hard drives I've plugged into the hub. In all, a solid value. Name: AmazonBasics USB 3.0 Cable - A-Male to B-Male - 6 Feet (1.8 Meters) Title: Excellent works great at 3' Review: I am using the 3' version of this cable and it works great. It work well with my external Seagate 3.0 drive. I just connected it and it worked flawlessly. The cable is sturdy and is gold plated for better connectivity (I assume that helps. There is no real way to test that at home).The cables are priced similarly to competitors. The nice thing about it being an Amazon product is that I am sure the return policy would be simple and quick. One word of caution is make sure both devices you are connecting are USB 3.0. The A side will fit in a 2.0 socket, but the B side will not. Check your devices documentation. It does no good to use this cable if both devices are not USB 3.0. You will create a bottleneck at the 2.0 side.Otherwise, this is a great little cable and you can't go wrong with it. Name: AmazonBasics USB 3.0 Cable - A-Male to B-Male - 6 Feet (1.8 Meters) Title: AmazonBasics in Gold Review: I found this wire to be of good quality. It performed as well as any other USB 3.0 cable and, to the extent that you would prefer something 'in black', this is the one to go. Amazon sells them in several lengths so you just get the right size.Of course, this is a generic USB 3.0 cable but it's nice that the connectors are or appear to be gold-plated. And, of course, it's an AmazonBasics which means that price is very much 'right' and you can always rely on Amazon's quick and efficient customer service and support. Name: AmazonBasics USB 3.0 Cable - A-Male to B-Male - 6 Feet (1.8 Meters) Title: Good quality USB 3.0 cable. Review: I have several AmazonBasics cables now and they've all been great. This particular AmazonBasics USB 3.0 cable is 9 feet long and delivers full bandwidth between my Mac and my external hard drive.Build quality is very good and the connectors are gold-plated to ensure data contact. AmazonBasics is well worth considering when shopping for cables.",

You can use apps like Kodi and TubiTV to watch many shows. My favorite is TubiTV.

    "summary_reviews_string":"Name: Echo (White),,,\r\nEcho (White),,, Title: Netflix, HBO Go, Amazon Prime and XBMC on one box... could it get any better! Review: I seriously wonder why it took me to get FireTV for so long. I originally had a Roku XS and then I stupidly bought a Roku 4. Both devices were all right but neither could handle 5.1 audio from Netflix on my Vizio sound bar (essentially your device must be cable of handling Dolby Digital Plus and nothing less using Roku). I finally decided to give FireTV a try and I'm amazed. Not only does it convert DD+ to DD on Netflix and HBO Go, I can install XBMC (Kodi) on it! I wish I knew about this before I bought my Roku 4 and HTPC. I now literally have no use for my HTPC anymore... FireTV can handle EVERYTHING now and all with DD and DTS 5.1 audio. Even better, I have a ton of smart devices and 3 Echos... I can now control all of these devices directly from the remote. This is seriously one of the best purchases I have made in the past year.

Was going to use this and cancel cable. When I told my cable company I wanted to cancel and I was just going to stream everything they cut my bundle cost by 100. I kept cable but I also still use my firetv alot. Name: Echo (White),,,\r\nEcho (White),,, Title: Great Review: Love it, had the stick and it was kinda slow navigating. This one is much faster.

Name: Echo (White),,,\r\nEcho (White),,, Title: Much better than Apple TV! Review: I bought this after being an avid Apple fan for the last 10 years. I had old style two Apple TV's and even bought a new Apple TV to help with me cutting the cord to DirectTV after 11 years. I switch to using the Apple TV with the DirecTV Now streaming service. After the Apple TV would no longer let friends or family airplay to it because of new updates or let me load any third party apps I knew it was time to switch. It was a great switch to the Fire TV and I have not looked back. I have been able to load numerous apps that are not available on the Apple TV such as Showbox and Kodi. My biggest complaint was the Fire TV remote was not able to control the volume on my sound bar like the Apple TV remote and was not able to turn my TV or sound bar on or off. The Sideclick remote was exactly what I needed. I was able to program the remote to control power and sound level, along with change the input on the TV. I would highly recommend using the Fire TV.Pros:Works extremely wellAllows 3rd party app installationMuch cheaper than Apple TVAllows use of amazon music which Apple TV did notCons:Home page is not at visually pleasing as the Apple TVRemote does not have volume controlsRemote is not touch sensitive and has a very loud *click* noise when pushing buttons.

    "summary_reviews_string":"Name: Fire Tablet, 7 Display, Wi-Fi, 8 GB - Includes Special Offers, Magenta Title: Great buy Review: I was looking for a good, cheap tablet for general use, and this fit the bill. The one thing that hits you outright is the build-in marketing Amazon uses in the tablet that you cannot remove. For instance, the home screen is filled with links for Amazon Video, Amazon Books, Amazon Gifts, etc, etc. You an't remove them, but I found out you can create a folder and drag each into that folder to essentially remove them.After that, install a free app for a File Manager then go in and rename the folder(s) that you create to make it easier to find apps that you hide. You will also need to install Adobe Reader to read PDF files, since it isn't installed.Another marketing scheme is that the screen saver is an ad each and every time you wake it. After a while though you get to ignore it.Performance is great - fast and easy to navigate. The built-in browser has everything you should need. Battery life looks really good. I had the screen brightness at about 1\/2 power and it looked good. The screen black level is really good and the contrast makes the colors sparkle. If you turn the brightness up too high, the colors begin to wash out a little.Amazon seems to offer this tablet at a lower price in exchange for their promotions of Amazon products. Once you get around that, you see the value you get in this tablet. Name: Fire Tablet, 7 Display, Wi-Fi, 8 GB - Includes Special Offers, Magenta Title: Amazing value! Review: This 7 inch tablet exceeded my expectations and then some. I was apprehensive about having advertising on the wake-up screen, but with a simple swipe of the thumb it goes away with no waiting. It streams Netflix and UV copies from Flixster with zero lag and no buffering. Expandable memory, (Micro SD). This is basically an android tablet, so if you have experience using that platform, you will have no trouble navigating the settings menu, etc. There is no Google Play store access, however, the Amazon App store is available and is pretty impressive. The resolution of the screen is sharp and clear. One of my complaints with my old tablet was the visibilty when viewing at an angle, but this tablet does not have the same issue. All in all, this $50 tablet is the best value I have seen, as it outperforms the dual core $250 tablet I just replaced. If you are looking for a 7 inch tablet, you can NOT go wrong with this one. Name: Fire Tablet, 7 Display, Wi-Fi, 8 GB - Includes Special Offers, Magenta Title: Amazon Free Time Ad machine Review: My view comes from being only a IPad user. And my purchase purpose was for a very young granddaughter whose sole purpose right now is to steal my Ipad to watch YouTube cartoons, and she operates it very well.I'm giving this 3 stars because I'm returning this in less than 24 hours. So I didn't give this much of a chance. First it seems it REALLY wants you to sign up for Amazon Free Time ($4.99 month). Guessing my experience would be a whole lot smoother if I did that.So created the child profile on the tablet, moved the YouTube app to the profile. Opened the app and got selections for Popular, Music, Movies etc... Could not locate a \"search\" feature. After repeated tapping, got Music to open. Only to get a warning that \"this content is restricted in the Amazon Free Time app\". What? So I have to join to unlock YouTube? I'm technically savy so the fact that I was frustrated didn't bear well for the granddaughter. Maybe there was another way around this but I didn't look. Should not have to.Couple this with the random ads for games, Amazon Prime, etc that pops up and that was enough for me. So going back to get a Windows tablet where you click on the YouTube app you get what you are expecting without restrictions. For the $49.99 price I had to try this. But not for me. Name: Fire Tablet, 7 Display, Wi-Fi, 8 GB - Includes Special Offers, Magenta Title: You get a lot for $50 Review: Bought this at Best Buy since I had a $10 reward coupon so only sent $40 for this tablet. Short story this tablet can do everything your smart phone can do and I kinda like Amazon's new OS running on this tablet better than Android, nice clean interface and very user friendly also like the way categories are on top and you can swipe right to view them. As far as speed is concern this tablet is good, you can jump from apps with ease (although installing new apps are a bit slower than on Android) the apps have installed are Facebook,Linkedin, Overdrive, CNN, Pandora, Pinterest, Skpe all run fine. You can even run games on this $50 device, games like Sky Force, Real Racing 3 (these game have high graphics) run surprisingly smooth. Videos on Netflix, HBO Now, Pluto Tv and Youtube look great even though they are not HD. Sound is just ok (my smartphone sounds better) and the display is good compared to other cheap tablets on the market that are not IPS. Battery life is good too, can go a couple of days without charging with just reading books, checking Facebook, surf the web and gaming. Already accidentally dropped my tablet on the floor with no damage at all.I not a Prime Member but purchase a lot from Amazon so this device is convenient when ordering books and other items. This tablet has been rock solid for the week I have it and it's still shocking to me regarding the price with no compromise in quality. Was going to buy the Amazon Fire HD but since my last $270 Amazon tablet was lost this makes more sense since it's at a price point where you can easily replace it. Amazon has really changed the game with this tablet, other's reviews that state that this is only for kids or beginner tablet owner's I disagree with. Now for the people who must have the best tablet on the market (looking at you Apple Ipad and Samsung) then this is not for you, but for others who need a device to do everyday task (just like your smartphone) then this is the one don't let the cheap price fool you. Name: Fire Tablet, 7 Display, Wi-Fi, 8 GB - Includes Special Offers, Magenta Title: great value for amazon prime members Review: a solid well made tablet that feels good in the hand. images are crisp & clean. works well with my hulu acct, hbogo acct, prime video acct too. the first few secs the video is blurry, then it clears up and plays fine. if you add a sd card the tablet automatically places apps & video on the sd card (if app allows) the great value for me is you can download amazon prime video (must be a current member) onto the sd card for offline viewing. i bet a lot of parents will love that for those long car trips. sound is good. BT worked well with my BT enabled stereo ( i streamed prime music & pandora). don't be put off by the screen resolution - it looks great. the new bellini OS is a MAJOR improvement over the old carousel format of days past. the new amazon app underground also adds to the value for prime members. the lock screen ads are not intrusive, once you swipe to unlock tablet they go away and do not reappear until you lock the screen again. if you're a prime member - this is the best 50 bucks you will spend! Name: Fire Tablet, 7 Display, Wi-Fi, 8 GB - Includes Special Offers, Magenta Title: Lov my computer Review: I've was married to the same man for 30 something yrs and they was the best time in my life we have kids that's all grown and they have kids now. I love them deeply but they all are upset with me because they haven't had a Christmas ,I always get my Grand kids something but it hasn't happen in 3 yrs. I can't seem to be able to afford it any more I thought the kids would love the tablet I know they will because they all stay on computer like me it's educational for them and my self. I'm disable and have nothing to do so Name: Fire Tablet, 7 Display, Wi-Fi, 8 GB - Includes Special Offers, Magenta Title: first time tablet Review: I purchased this to read books and check out ebooks from the library. I love it and it's easy to use. This is in color and you can even play games on it. It's small enough to fit in my purse so while I'm at appointments I can read and if my son gets board, he can play games. Name: Fire Tablet, 7 Display, Wi-Fi, 8 GB - Includes Special Offers, Magenta Title: Great Fire for the money Review: I love this tablet. It works very well. I bought it because I love to read ebooks and read the Bible app. Having a 7\" screen makes this easy.As far as apps go, it has Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest and tumblr available. It does not have Instagram available in the app store. I knew that going into it, because I've owned kindle fire tablets in the past.This Fire is so lightweight, and I love that. One tablet I owned previously was almost too heavy for my purse.This tablet has a browser, called the Silk browser, and it works well, although I don't use it for that.When it comes to games, the appstore has most of all the popular ones like candy crush. Pandora is also available.This Fire is an excellent value for the money, and I truly mean that. Perfect for kids too Name: Fire Tablet, 7 Display, Wi-Fi, 8 GB - Includes Special Offers, Magenta Title: Great price! Review: I do most of my things on my laptop but I wanted something to use while watching TV and so on. I saw this tablet and had to look twice because I thought maybe it was just a reader! I have used this installing apps, playing games, reading, texting on a free text app, Facebooking and so on. The apps are a little sluggish to install but once they are on they are speedy and work well. The clearness of the screen is so much better than any low line tablet at this price range. The tablet feels of good quality. It is not flimsy and cheap feeling. We bought two and are extremely happy. The trick is not to expect it to run like and upper line tablet. Love it for what it is ;) Name: Fire Tablet, 7 Display, Wi-Fi, 8 GB - Includes Special Offers, Magenta Title: Amazon tablet for $50?! No brainer! Review: This is a name brand tablet for less than the case of other tablets! This is a no brainer and will make great Christmas gifts! Name: Fire Tablet, 7 Display, Wi-Fi, 8 GB - Includes Special Offers, Magenta Title: Best Tablet you can get for 50$ Review: I have dabbled in the market for a inexpensive tablet for a while and found this and boy am I glad I did. Tablet runs faster than I thought and has a very good display. If you can't afford an Ipad get this! Name: Fire Tablet, 7 Display, Wi-Fi, 8 GB - Includes Special Offers, Magenta Title: Best tablet for the Amazon Android Store? Review: This is the possibly the best Tablet if you are an Amazon store\/prime centric user. But, it doesn't include the Google Play Store and doesn't include most \/ any of the Google apps, which are stables in the Tablet world. No Google Inbox, etc. For me, this tablet is a \"skip\". But, it's cheap and if it meets your needs you might love it. Name: Fire Tablet, 7 Display, Wi-Fi, 8 GB - Includes Special Offers, Magenta Title: A nice tablet for books. That's really it. Review: Apps run okay but the real problem is streaming and internet browsing. I'm telling you, generic tablets are faster... I thought it was my internet at first but all my other devices work phenomenally fast. I first noticed this after I started using it but I thought I would give it a shot. I've decided to return this and exchange for another $50 tablet tomorrow. This is because I couldn't even watch a simple youtube video today.Here's what I did like. It's name brand. The games are nice and mostly ad free. It uses Android 5.0 but uses their own app store. Reading books is great. Library app is kinda slow but still works.Perfect cheap tablet for kids age 6 to 13 maybe... Name: Fire Tablet, 7 Display, Wi-Fi, 8 GB - Includes Special Offers, Magenta Title: Damaged Screen Review: The Fire 7 has a great price! You get your money's worth. However, you may have to do an exchange if you get a damaged one. The one I bought had a busted pixel in the screen. There was no damage to the case or glass screen, but the image had a bright white puncture hole in the screen's image. I've owned multiple, but I have never had this problem before with an ePad tablet when I just bought it. I will now have to visit Best Buy again tomorrow for an exchange. I'm hoping they're still in stock. It's not Best Buy's fault. The fault lies with Amazon. They're clearly not that durable. Name: Fire Tablet, 7 Display, Wi-Fi, 8 GB - Includes Special Offers, Magenta Title: Great for the kids and adults Review: Bought this for my daughter (7 yrs), and ended up getting a second one for my son. I do wish Best Buy sold the kid-proof cases, but meh.The tablet is quick, the memory is expandable as well, which is what keeps me from anything iWhatever. Throw a 64GB card in this and your kid can make videos on Musical.ly all dang day and become a YouTube sensation (still waiting on that check).PARENTAL NOTE: If you go this route, take advantage of Amazon's FreeTime. It's fantastic, customizable, safe and easy to stay hands-off. I use it with both tablets with both kids. Time limits, no questionable content (depending on what you call questionable; i hate KidzBop) and excellent apps, etc included.Tablet is more than powerful enough for adulting, too, so if you despise kids, you can still enjoy your lonely, hollow, selfish existence with this outstanding tablet. Name: Fire Tablet, 7 Display, Wi-Fi, 8 GB - Includes Special Offers, Magenta Title: Works, just view appstore 1st Review: It works great. Not affected by the singular WiFi band at all.Battery life is amazing.Just be sure you can get the apps you'd like from the appstore, google play isn't accessible. So if you're looking for Snapchat, Instagram, NBC, Comcast, Vudu, you won't get those here.Returning it. Which is too bad, I really enjoyed it. More bang for the buck if you could access those apps. But like I said, it was my fault for not checking first. I was expecting the 'apps from unknown sources' to kick in but it so didn't. Name: Fire Tablet, 7 Display, Wi-Fi, 8 GB - Includes Special Offers, Magenta Title: Great value Review: It amazes me that this tablet is less than fifty dollars. Is it going to replace an ipad? No but it's not meant to. It is great for watching hulu and net flix. Amazon underground is pretty amazing also. Well worth $50. If you are on the fence about it just buy it. You won't regret it at all. Name: Fire Tablet, 7 Display, Wi-Fi, 8 GB - Includes Special Offers, Magenta Title: Sale price is unbelievable Review: Picked one of these Fire tablets up today for the crazy price of $39.99. I didn't really need it, but the extra $10. of was just too tempting. Charged it up, connected to WiFi and all was good to go. Played around with it for a couple of hours and it worked perfectly. Video and sound were good, speed was nice, and I am really impressed with the price. My wife's Kindle paperwhite case cost as much as this full feature tablet. Time will tell about longevity, but first impression is, this is a great little tablet.. Name: Fire Tablet, 7 Display, Wi-Fi, 8 GB - Includes Special Offers, Magenta Title: Price is low. Quality is lower than others.. Review: I purchased this amazon fire. Because, Reviews are good. But, I realized they left reviews before they receive it.I found couple of issues not to buy this tablet.1. It is impossible to use google account.Even You can log in gmail account.2. Bad for web surfing. There are so many limits for web surfing.3.This issue is only for Koreans. It is impossible to type & see Korean language.Do not buy this tablet if you are Korean.I do not know why this tablet does not support Korean. Even supports other Asian countries languages as like Chinese, Japanese. Etc....",

I work in IT and I research the heck out of products before I buy. I had an iPad Mini 2 that was just not up to snuff with iOS 10 so I sold it and bought (and eventually returned) the 2016 Fire HD 8. First let me say it's a great tablet for the price and for probably 50-60% of tablet users who surf the web and watch Netflix. It also helps if you are a heavy Amazon content user. For me, I was spoiled by the retina display on the iPad. The 720p display is alright, but you can see the pixels. 189ppi is pretty low by today's standards. The other big thing for me was the lack of a laminated display. It's glare city on this thing. Display nitpicks aside, it punches above its price point. If you don't play really heavy games (which it even plays Titan Quest surprisingly well!) and you don't mind not having an absolutely beautiful screen I think it runs and works fine. It just wasn't for me. I bit the bullet and went with a 128GB iPad Air 2 as its on special at BB for super cheap right now. Name: All-New Fire HD 8 Tablet, 8 HD Display, Wi-Fi, 16 GB - Includes Special Offers, Magenta Title: Great Alternative to College Textbooks Review: I bought my Fire HD8 as an alternative to carrying around my laptop and having to buy many textbooks for college. The fact that I saved well over $150 on one of the 5 books I had to get this semester was a godsend. Most all undergraduate courses I have seen are offered in eBook form for Kindle. If you do not care about having the constant ability of being on the internet without WiFi or other hotspot, it's a great resource. Pros:Price for this was still less than the money saved for my Biology Book.A lot less weight that 5 college textbooks.So far all books I need for college are available as eBooks through Amazon.A single charge can make it through an 8 hour school day.Cons:If you want\/need a network connection, you have to use your phone as a hotspot or connect to another WiFi network. Bottom line, I wanted a cheaper alternative to having to lug over $750 in books around. I came out at well under $500 considering I bought this.

I went with the staff member's recommendation and I am so glad I did. I love the internet safety organ on it through Amazon. $2.50 a month per kid for unlimited age related and child safe Internet access and movies, books, games and apps and I can set the time it shuts off and a minimum time for them to read each day. Love love love. Name: All-New Fire HD 8 Tablet, 8 HD Display, Wi-Fi, 16 GB - Includes Special Offers, Magenta Title: A Lot of Bang for the Buck! Review: I read about this new 8\" Amazon tablet in the New York Times. My Google Nexus 7, 4 years old, was getting slower and slower, and I needed to upgrade - for as little money as possible.This Amazon Fire 8\" is an excellent value for the money(only $89!) - very fast, great screen resolution, and easy to use. I was skeptical of the Silk browser, which I'd never heard of, but it works fine. There is no \"page forward\" arrow, which is odd, only backwards, but I can live with that.It has exceeded my expectations and I'm very happy with it. I'm not in the Amazon ecosystem, this is my first foray, and it's a good one! Congrats to Amazon for making an affordable, great quality tablet!Also, the purchasing experience at Best Buy was easy and convenient, as always!

She does not like androids at all but I couldn't afford a expensive tablet for her. So we took a chance with this one. She is pleased and I'm pleased it seems so sturdy , not cheap quality at all. Going to get our youngest child one now. Very pleased.

She mainly uses this for books , email and some games so this is the perfect tablet for her. better graphics and quicker with the 16gb storage Name: All-New Fire HD 8 Tablet, 8 HD Display, Wi-Fi, 16 GB - Includes Special Offers, Magenta Title: Great for ebooks for school.

Personally, I wish there were ways to mirror the screen to a tv without having to purchase a Fire TV streaming stick. Also, the inability to use the google play store is a major set back. If it weren't for those two complaint, I'd give this tablet 4 stars.

The other big thing for me was the lack of a laminated display. It's glare city on this thing. Display nitpicks aside, it punches above its price point. If you don't play really heavy games (which it even plays Titan Quest surprisingly well!) and you don't mind not having an absolutely beautiful screen I think it runs and works fine. It just wasn't for me. I bit the bullet and went with a 128GB iPad Air 2 as its on special at BB for super cheap right now.

The fact that I saved well over $150 on one of the 5 books I had to get this semester was a godsend. Most all undergraduate courses I have seen are offered in eBook form for Kindle. If you do not care about having the constant ability of being on the internet without WiFi or other hotspot, it's a great resource. Pros:Price for this was still less than the money saved for my Biology Book.A lot less weight that 5 college textbooks.So far all books I need for college are available as eBooks through Amazon.A single charge can make it through an 8 hour school day.Cons:If you want\/need a network connection, you have to use your phone as a hotspot or connect to another WiFi network. Bottom line, I wanted a cheaper alternative to having to lug over $750 in books around. I came out at well under $500 considering I bought this.

I went with the staff member's recommendation and I am so glad I did. I love the internet safety organ on it through Amazon. $2.50 a month per kid for unlimited age related and child safe Internet access and movies, books, games and apps and I can set the time it shuts off and a minimum time for them to read each day. Love love love.

Name: Fire HD 8 Tablet with Alexa, 8 HD Display, 16 GB, Tangerine - with Special Offers Title: A Lot of Bang for the Buck! Review: I read about this new 8\" Amazon tablet in the New York Times. My Google Nexus 7, 4 years old, was getting slower and slower, and I needed to upgrade - for as little money as possible.This Amazon Fire 8\" is an excellent value for the money(only $89!) - very fast, great screen resolution, and easy to use. I was skeptical of the Silk browser, which I'd never heard of, but it works fine. There is no \"page forward\" arrow, which is odd, only backwards, but I can live with that.It has exceeded my expectations and I'm very happy with it. I'm not in the Amazon ecosystem, this is my first foray, and it's a good one! Congrats to Amazon for making an affordable, great quality tablet!Also, the purchasing experience at Best Buy was easy and convenient, as always! Name: Fire HD 8 Tablet with Alexa, 8 HD Display, 16 GB, Tangerine - with Special Offers Title: Really great for the price! Review: Got this for my 9 year old after her ipad crashed and burned. She does not like androids at all but I couldn't afford a expensive tablet for her. So we took a chance with this one. She is pleased and I'm pleased it seems so sturdy , not cheap quality at all. Going to get our youngest child one now. Very pleased. Name: Fire HD 8 Tablet with Alexa, 8 HD Display, 16 GB, Tangerine - with Special Offers Title: Very descent Review: Very descent for a non-IPAD. Good speakers. Great price. The screen is a little dark. Great buy if you have Amazon Prime since you can download stuff and watch it offline (great for trips, etc...). Overall great cheap IPAD or even as a back-up tablet. Terrific battery life too. Name: Fire HD 8 Tablet with Alexa, 8 HD Display, 16 GB, Tangerine - with Special Offers Title: Great tablet for general use Review: I bought this for my wife to replace her 7\" fire that was having a hard time holding a charge anymore. She is thrilled! It was easy for her to transfer all of her books and apps from her old fire to this. She mainly uses this for books , email and some games so this is the perfect tablet for her. better graphics and quicker with the 16gb storage Name: Fire HD 8 Tablet with Alexa, 8 HD Display, 16 GB, Tangerine - with Special Offers Title: Great for hearing impaired in downloading videos Review: Light to carry and good picture quality. This was purchased for a hearing impaired person to download video in American Sign Language . This product was easy to maneuver for someone that was not use to a tablet. Name: Fire HD 8 Tablet with Alexa, 8 HD Display, 16 GB, Tangerine - with Special Offers Title: Great tablet for the price Review: The Amazon Fire HD8 (2016 model) is a great tablet for the price; however, the Fire OS offers limited abilities to the user. Personally, I wish there were ways to mirror the screen to a tv without having to purchase a Fire TV streaming stick. Also, the inability to use the google play store is a major set back. If it weren't for those two complaint, I'd give this tablet 4 stars. Name: Fire HD 8 Tablet with Alexa, 8 HD Display, 16 GB, Tangerine - with Special Offers Title: Good Reader with Internet benefits Review: I use this primarily as a reader; however, it has a smaller number of unread books that are not in the familiar \"carousel\" as in other Kindle readers. As a tablet it is faster, brighter and more clear than other tablets that I have used for internet purposes. I would recommend this product to anyone who uses a tablet or a reader. Name: Fire HD 8 Tablet with Alexa, 8 HD Display, 16 GB, Tangerine - with Special Offers Title: Solid tablet with potential Review: I like this tablet. It has everything you want. However the apps within it need to be updated more often. If this happened than it would be top above an iPad mini. For now, it gives me enough of what I need and in HD. For $89 it was a good deal. Name: Fire HD 8 Tablet with Alexa, 8 HD Display, 16 GB, Tangerine - with Special Offers Title: Needed the bigger tablet. Review: I went from the 7 inch Kindle to the 8 and it really made a difference. Easier to read and clearer than my old one. Name: Fire HD 8 Tablet with Alexa, 8 HD Display, 16 GB, Tangerine - with Special Offers Title: Fire works for me Review: Smartphone works on the job for me, but with the Fire I can read instructions and worksheets. It is a useful tool for connecting with both friends and colleagues. 8-inches is the right size for holding in hand and carrying with you. Gives me the information, beats printing everything out, or carrying around a large laptop. Name: Fire HD 8 Tablet with Alexa, 8 HD Display, 16 GB, Tangerine - with Special Offers Title: Great value tablet!! Review: Not to much to complain about. for less than 100 dollars you get an 8in tablet that has pretty good specs; expandable storage, long battery life, great speakers, fast processor, decent cameras and hi def screen. easy to use and well built tablet....The only knock is the included adds but, after using it for awhile you barely notice it.
